              <TypographyP>
                Healthy communication is the foundation of all strong relationships. In college,
                you'll navigate relationships with roommates, friends, romantic partners,
                professors, and family members—often while dealing with stress, new independence,
                and changing identities. Learning to communicate effectively can reduce conflict,
                strengthen bonds, and protect your mental health.

              <TypographyP>
                Before learning to express yourself better, it's crucial to become a better
                listener. Active listening builds trust and understanding, making others more
                receptive to what you have to say.

                      Healthy communication is a skill that improves with practice. Be patient with
                      yourself as you learn to express your needs and listen to others more
                      effectively. Good communication takes effort from both parties, and you can
                      only control your part of the conversation. Focus on being authentic,
                      respectful, and open to growth.
